# Getting Started with Tic Tac Toe
### ARE YOU READY TO BE DESTROYED IN A GAME OF TIC TAC TOE? 
### BRING YOUR GREATEST SELF TO FACE OFF AGAINST THE ALMIGHTY AI
### IT IS A BATTLE OF LIFE AND DEATH! (Well, not really) BUT FEEL THE PRESSURE 
### MAY THE ODDS BE IN YOUR FAVOR (*insert dramatic music*)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 
This will install the necessary packages to run this code.
If you run into issues, it might be with the `lottie-files` package. You can run this: `npm i react-lottie -force`

This will force install that package

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
